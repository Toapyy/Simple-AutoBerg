# Simple AutoBerg
 Hello! I made this because somepeople have a hard time with Mr. Goldberg's emulator. it's a very basic setup I tried to make this as simple as possible so all you have to do is click and drag your folder to the program :)

 I think it works good for windows, I didn't test so much for linux so if there needs changes please let me know!

- termcolor v1.1.0

if you are untrusting you can install Mr Goldberg's program yourself and put the files in the directories :) please make sure that the directories are not unchanged.
